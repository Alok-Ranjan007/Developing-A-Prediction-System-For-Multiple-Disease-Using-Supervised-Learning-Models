# Developing-A-Prediction-System-For-Multiple-Disease-Using-Supervised-Learning-Models
An AI-driven health diagnostic tool utilizing Machine Learning to predict Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson’s. Built with Python and Streamlit, it features trained SVM and Logistic Regression models to provide real-time risk assessments from clinical data. This project offers a seamless UI for early diagnosis and data-driven healthcare.
A comprehensive machine learning-based application designed to predict the likelihood of multiple diseases (such as Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson's) based on user-provided clinical data. This project leverages various classification algorithms and provides a user-friendly interface via Streamlit.📋 Table of ContentsOverviewFeaturesDataset InformationInstallationUsageModel PerformanceTech StackContributing🔍 OverviewEarly diagnosis is critical for effective treatment. This repository contains the source code for a web-based diagnostic tool. By inputting specific medical parameters (like glucose levels, blood pressure, or vocal frequencies), the system utilizes pre-trained models to provide an instant health assessment.Supported Diseases:Diabetes: Predicts based on BMI, insulin, age, etc.Heart Disease: Predicts based on chest pain type, cholesterol, and heart rate.Parkinson’s Disease: Predicts using voice-related features and MDVP measures.✨ FeaturesMulti-Disease Support: Access three different diagnostic tools in one dashboard.Real-time Prediction: Get instant results upon submitting data.Intuitive UI: Clean sidebar navigation and responsive input fields.Scalable: Easy to add new disease models by following the modular code structure.📊 Dataset InformationThe models were trained using datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and Kaggle.DiseaseDataset SourceKey Features UsedDiabetesPima Indians DatasetGlucose, Blood Pressure, BMIHeart DiseaseCleveland Heart DiseaseAge, Sex, CP, ThalachParkinson'sOxford Parkinson'sMDVP (Hz), Shimmer, HNR⚙️ InstallationTo run this project locally, follow these steps:Clone the Repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/your-username/multiple-disease-prediction.git
